## How to run locally
- Make sure you have Java 11 or newer, Gradle, Docker and PostgreSQL
- cd to project root
- run: docker-compose up -d testsdb
- run: ./gradlew bootRun(this will take some time because the db has to be created) <- this will run the app
- Wait approximately for 5 minutes for the database to initialise (text "Database has been initialised" will be displayed to the terminal)
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/api/stock/{symbol}`

## How to run only with docker

  - cd to project root
    - run ./gradlew build -x test(without tests because tests will take a long time to complete)
      - run: docker image build -t bootdocker:staging .
        - We usually  run docker-compose.yml file container graphically but you can use:
          - docker-compose up -d testsdb : for starting h2 db in docker
          - docker-compose up -d: for starting all containers

## How to run tests
- Run Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml testsdb
- Select test module and run tests with coverage
- Because we are using an external API and tests have to run on different threads and database has to be initilised, running test takes time (approximately 30 minutes to run all tests).
